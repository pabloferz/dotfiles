# Vim-Airline Rounded Edges Fix

## The Problem

The original configuration had an issue when files with warning sections were edited, causing the statusline to appear one character short. This happened because:

1. **Section Array Manipulation**: The original code was directly assigning to `a:builder._sections` instead of properly inserting/appending elements
2. **Empty Section Handling**: No checks for empty sections or edge cases
3. **Index Assumptions**: The code assumed `sections[0]` and `sections[-1]` would always exist and be meaningful

## The Root Cause

In your original code:
```vim
let a:builder._sections = [['', '%#' . left_group . '_edge#']]
let a:builder._sections += sections
let a:builder._sections = [['', '%#' . right_group . '_edge#']]
```

The problem was the last line - it was **replacing** the entire sections array with just the right edge, effectively removing all content! This is why you saw the statusline being one character short.

## The Solution

The fixed version properly handles section manipulation:

### Key Improvements:

1. **Proper Array Manipulation**:
   ```vim
   " Insert left edge at the beginning
   call insert(a:builder._sections, ['', '%#' . left_group . '_edge#'], 0)
   
   " Append right edge at the end
   call add(a:builder._sections, ['', '%#' . right_group . '_edge#'])
   ```

2. **Empty Section Handling**:
   ```vim
   " Handle empty sections gracefully
   if empty(sections)
     return 1
   endif
   ```

3. **Smart Section Detection**:
   ```vim
   " Find first non-empty section from left
   while left_idx < len(sections) && empty(sections[left_idx][1])
     let left_idx += 1
   endwhile
   
   " Find first non-empty section from right
   while right_idx >= 0 && empty(sections[right_idx][1])
     let right_idx -= 1
   endwhile
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Theme Patching**: `AirlineThemePatch()` creates `_edge` variants for all highlight groups
2. **Section Processing**: `AirlineRoundedEdges()` is called for both active and inactive statuslines
3. **Edge Insertion**: The function finds the actual leftmost and rightmost sections and adds edge highlights
4. **Warning Section Compatibility**: Now properly handles warning sections and other dynamic sections

## Testing the Fix

To test the fix:

1. Reload your vim configuration: `:source ~/.vimrc`
2. Open a file that triggers warnings (e.g., a Python file with syntax issues)
3. Check that the statusline displays correctly with rounded edges
4. Verify that the statusline length is consistent across different file types

## Visual Result

The statusline should now have consistent rounded edges regardless of whether warning sections are present, with proper highlighting that matches the adjacent sections.
